2. One advantage to separating tabs into processes rather than threads is that the tabs do not
share resources and do not communicate with each other. This means that each one operates in
isolation from the others, and if one crashes it will not affect the other, whereas the failure of
one thread might affect the others. Furthermore, the isolation between processes means that code run
in one process can not “touch” the other processes, which creates a more secure environment from
processes that might be running malicious or irresponsible code, as might happen on the internet.
The disadvantage of running processes rather than threads is that it is much slower to create and
terminate a new process and to switch between them, and it requires more memory to maintain separate
processes.

4. Real time refers to the actual time that has passed in the world and in the system, regardless of
 what process is running. Virtual time refers to the amount of time that a thread or process has
 been running. The real time of a program is thus at least a sum of the virtual times of its threads
  and processes. Real time would be used when the real-world timing matters to the running of the
  program, such as an alarm set for a certain time. Virtual time will be used to track how long a
  process or thread has run, such as setting a timeout for an amount of time we want to allocate a
  certain task.

5. sigsetjmp: Saves the current thread's environment in its env field for later use.
siglongjmp: Restores the environment that was saved in the call to sigsetjmp.
These functions allow us to save a thread's state and switch between them while each thread still
maintains its environment.
